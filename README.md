# Virtual-Mouse-with-Hand-Gestures-
Created a touchless virtual mouse using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to control cursor and clicks through hand gestures. Enabled real-time hand tracking with gesture recognition for actions like move and click. Designed to work reliably across various lighting conditions for accessible, hands-free control.
